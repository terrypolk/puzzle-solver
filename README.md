# Puzzle Solver

At Christmas 2005, a family member got a 16 piece, two-sided puzzle that you were to solve by creating a 4x4 grid.

It was harder than I expected, so I wrote a Perl script to find the solution.
I was surprised to see how many possible solutions there were.  

It's been a long time since I've looked at this.  Apparently I looked for "one-sided" solutions by randomly picking a single side of the puzzle pieces and restricting solutions to that configuration.
Then I allowed the pieces to be flipped.

The html files give a visual representation of the solutions.
